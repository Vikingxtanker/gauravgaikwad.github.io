<p>FDA Approves First Oral GLP-1 Agonist for Type 2 Diabetes</p>

<p><em>Published: August 2025</em></p>

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved oral semaglutide (brand name: Rybelsus®) as the first oral GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This breakthrough provides patients an alternative to injectable GLP-1 agonists, offering improved convenience and adherence.</p>

<p>Clinical trials have demonstrated that oral semaglutide significantly reduces HbA1c levels and supports weight management, making it a valuable addition to current diabetes therapy options. Healthcare professionals are advised to consider its use in patients who require better glycemic control and prefer oral therapy over injections.</p>
